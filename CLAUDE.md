# Project Rules

## Git Commits

**NEVER add any of the following to commit messages:**
- "Generated with Claude Code" or similar attribution
- "Co-Authored-By: Claude" or any Claude co-author line
- Any mention of AI assistance in commits

Commit messages should be clean and professional, written as if authored solely by the developer.
